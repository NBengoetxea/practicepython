#Take a list, say for example this one:
#a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
#and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.
#Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements less than 5 from this list in it and print out this new list.

#Create the list
a=[1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89]
#Create the new empty list where I will add the numbers under the condition >5
b=[]


for x in a: #Loop to analyze every number of the list
    if x < 5: #if they are under the condition
       b.append(x) #add to the new list
    else: 
        break #sino parar
print(b) #imprimir la nueval ista
